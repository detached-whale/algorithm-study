testdome javascript interview question no.6 (https://www.testdome.com/d/javascript-interview-questions/2)
<br><br>
Your company assigns each customer a membership ID, and you are implementing a check digit for those IDs.
<br><br>
The check digit should be calculated by adding up all digits in each membership ID. If the result of the sum is a number with more than a single digit, another iteration is required, and the digits of the result also should be added together. This process should repeat until a single-digit number is calculated.
<br><br>
For example, for the membership ID "55555" the sum of all digits is 25. Because this is not a single-digit number, 2 and 5 would be added, and the result, 7, would be the check digit.

<script>
function createCheckDigit(membershipId) {
  var ary = membershipId.split('');
  var sum = 0;
  for (const element of ary) {
    sum += parseInt(element);
  }

  if(sum >= 10) {
	return 0 + createCheckDigit(sum.toString());
  }

  else {
    return sum;
  }
}

console.log(createCheckDigit('55555'));
</script>
