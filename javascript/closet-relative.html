testdome javascript interview question no.11 (https://www.testdome.com/d/javascript-interview-questions/2)
<br><br>
The following HTML represents a family tree:
<xmp>
<James>
    <Dave></Dave>
    <Mike></Mike>
    <Sarah></Sarah>
</James>
</xmp>

Implement the closestRelative function so that when a parent HTML element is passed, the function returns the parent's closest relative whose name matches the relativeName, and obeys the following rules:
<br><br>
 - The parent parameter is the HTML element of which the closest relative will be a descendant.<br>
 - Each member of the family, including children, may also be a parent to one or more children.<br>
 - Children are more closely related to the parent than grandchildren.<br>
 - If several children in the same generation have the same name, then the first child in the tree is considered the closer relative.
 - If no matching relative is found the function should return null.<br>
<br>
For example, the below code should print 'MIKE' for the given family tree:
<xmp>
let parent = document.getElementsByTagName('James')[0];
let relative = closestRelative(parent, 'Mike');
console.log(relative && relative.tagName); // prints MIKE
</xmp>

<James>
    <Dave></Dave>
    <Mike></Mike>
    <Sarah></Sarah>
</James>

</body>

<script>
function closestRelative(parent, relativeName) {
  var children = parent.children;

  for (let child of children) {
    if(child.tagName === relativeName.toUpperCase()) {
      return child
    }
  }

  for (let child of children) {
    let temp = closestRelative(child, relativeName);
    if(temp != null) {
      return temp;  
    }
  }

  return null;
}

let parent = document.getElementsByTagName('James')[0];
let relative = closestRelative(parent, 'Mike');

console.log(relative && relative.tagName);
