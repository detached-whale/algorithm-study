<br><br>
A playlist is considered a repeating playlist if any of the songs contain a reference to a previous song in the playlist. Otherwise, the playlist will end with the last song which points to undefined.
<br><br>
Implement the method isRepeatingPlaylist that, efficiently with respect to time used, returns true if a playlist is repeating or false if it is not.
<br><br>
For example, the following code prints "true" as both songs point to each other.

<script>
class Song {
  name;
  nextSong;

  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  
  /**
   * @return {boolean} true if the playlist is repeating, false if not.
   */
  isRepeatingPlaylist() {
  	const played = new Set();
  	played.add(this.name);

  	var next = this.nextSong;
  	while (next != undefined) {
  		if (played.has(next.name)) {
  			return true
  		}
		played.add(next.name);
		next = next.nextSong;
  	}
  	return false
  }
}

let first = new Song('Hello');
let second = new Song('Eye of the tiger');

first.nextSong = second;
second.nextSong = first;

console.log(first.isRepeatingPlaylist());
