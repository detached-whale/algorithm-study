testdome javascript interview question no.14 (https://www.testdome.com/d/javascript-interview-questions/2)
<br><br>
Write a function that, when passed an array and a target sum, returns, efficiently with respect to time used, two distinct zero-based indices of any two of the numbers, whose sum is equal to the target sum. If there are no two numbers, the function should return null.
<br><br>
For example, findTwoSum([ 3, 1, 5, 7, 5, 9 ], 10) should return an array containing any of the following pairs of indices:
<br>
 - 0 and 3 (or 3 and 0) as 3 + 7 = 10<br>
 - 1 and 5 (or 5 and 1) as 1 + 9 = 10<br>
 - 2 and 4 (or 4 and 2) as 5 + 5 = 10<br>

<script>
/**
 * @param {number[]} numbers The array of numbers.
 * @param {number} sum The required target sum.
 * @return {number[]} An array of 2 indices. The indices of the two elements whose sum is equal to sum.
 */
function findTwoSum(numbers, sum) {
  let diff = new Map()

  for(let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    if(diff.has(numbers[i])) {
      return [diff.get(numbers[i]), i];
    }
    else {
      diff.set(sum - numbers[i], i);
    }
  }

  return null;
}

const indices = findTwoSum([ 3, 1, 5, 7, 5, 9 ], 10);
console.log(indices);
